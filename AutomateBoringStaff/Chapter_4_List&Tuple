In a slice, the first integer is the index where the slice starts. 
The second integer is the index where the slice ends. 
A slice goes up to, but will not include, the value at the second index. 
A slice evaluates to a new list value.

>>> spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant'] >>> spam[0:4]
['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
>>> spam[1:3]
['bat', 'rat']
>>> spam[0:-1] ['cat', 'bat', 'rat']

del()函数用来删除list数据
>>> spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant'] >>> del spam[2]
>>> spam
['cat', 'bat', 'elephant']

list如何进行分解赋值
>>> cat = ['fat', 'black', 'loud'] >>> size = cat[0]
>>> color = cat[1]
>>> disposition = cat[2]
you could type this line of code:
>>> cat = ['fat', 'black', 'loud'] 
>>> size, color, disposition = cat

list的method
list.append()后面添加
list.index()找到一个值得index
list.insert(index=N,str)在index N之前插入str
list.remove()除去某个value，如果多个重复值，只删除第一个

You can also split up a single instruction across multiple lines using the \ line continuation character at the end . 
Think of \ as saying, “This instruction continues on the next line .” 
The indentation on the line after a \ line continua- tion is not significant . For example, the following is valid Python code:
print('Four score and seven ' + \ 'years ago...')

Reference
#列表实际上是一个指向地址的指针
When you assign a list to a variable, you are actually assigning a list reference to the variable. 
A reference is a value that points to some bit of data, and a list reference is a value that points to a list. 
>>> spam = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] v>>> cheese = spam
>>> cheese[1] = 'Hello!'
>>> spam
[0, 'Hello!', 2, 3, 4, 5] 
>>> cheese
[0, 'Hello!', 2, 3, 4, 5]

用copy.copy()去进行复制
>>> import copy
>>> spam = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'] 
>>> cheese = copy.copy(spam) 
>>> cheese[1] = 42
>>> spam
['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
>>> cheese
['A', 42, 'C', 'D']
